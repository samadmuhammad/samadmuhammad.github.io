		<h2>General Info on Chlorine</h2>	
			<p>Chlorine is an interesting element, and has some history on it as well.The origin of chlorine came from the Greek word “Chloros” meaning greenish yellow. Chlorine is in group 17, period 3, in block P,  has an atomic number of 17, and chlorine is in a gas state <a href="http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/17/chlorine">(Royal Society of Chemistry)</a>.
			</p>
			<p>Chlorine was produced for the first time by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Wilhelm-Scheele">Carl Wilhelm Scheele</a>. Carl Wilhelm was a chemist by trait when he combined the mineral pyrolusite (MnO2) with Hydrochloric acid (HCi) in 1774, when Carl did this experiment he thought that the gas produced was oxygen, but <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/humphry-davy-9268399#synopsis">Sir Humphry Davy</a> proved that this gas was a distinct element in 1810 <a href="http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele017.html">(Jefferson Lab)</a>.

		<h2>The use in World War One</h2>
			<p>At the outbreak of WW1 in 1914 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fritz-Haber">Fritz Haber</a>, a chemist by trait, offered to help the German army. He began experimenting the Chlorine gas  to be used in the trench warfare. This really made the opposing army suffer, since chlorine gas has an effect makes your death slow and painful <a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/FWWchlorine.htm">(Spartacus Educational)</a>. The only way to stop them from dying was to pee in their rags and breath through their rags. This was thought about by a Canadian Chemist.

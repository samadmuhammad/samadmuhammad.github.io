		<h2>General information on arsenic</h2>	
		<p>Arsenic is the third element in the fifteenth column of the periodic table. It is classified as a metalloid because it has some properties similar to a metal and others of a non-metal. Arsenic atoms have 33 electrons and 33 protons with 5 valence electrons in the outer shell. Arsenic is a very poisonous element! Upon heating, it can sublimate(transfer from a solid state to gaseous state)but if compressed it may be forced to enter a liquid state.<a href="https://www.webelements.com/arsenic/">Arsenic: the essentials</a></p>
		<h3>Characteristics and properties</h3>
		<p>Arsenic is an element with a various amount of allotropes. Allotropes are different structures of the same element. Although they are made up of the same element, their different structures can have very different characteristics. For example, carbon has the allotropes graphite and diamond. Arsenic's two most common allotropes are yellow and metallic grey. Grey arsenic is a brittle shiny solid. Yellow arsenic is soft and waxy. It is reactive, very toxic and is produced when the arsenic vapors are cooled suddenly.<a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/chemistry/compounds-and-elements/arsenic#3427000018">Arsenic(Revised)</a></p>
		<h3>Discovery and naming</h3>
		<p>Throughout ancient history, arsenic is known to be a compound of sulphur. It is thought that it was first isolated by German philosopher named Albert the Great aka Albertus Magnus in 1250. Arsenic may have gotten its name from the Greek word "arsenikon" which means "yellow pigment" or "arsenikos" which means "potent".<a href="https://www.hobart.k12.in.us/ksms/PeriodicTable/arsenic.htm">Arsenic</a></p>
		<h3>Health Effects</h3>
		<p>Arsenic is perhaps most famous for its high toxicity. This means that it is very poisonous. Many of its compounds are poisonous as well. Also, exposure to small amounts of arsenic over time can cause many health issues, such as irritation of the stomach and intestines, decreased production of red and white blood cells, skin changes and lung irritation. When high doses of arsenic are taken, the chances of cancer development, especially the chances of development of skin cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer and lymphatic cancer drastically rise. A very high exposure to arsenic can cause infertility and miscarriages with women, and it can cause skin disturbances, declined resistance to infections, heart disruptions and brain damage with both men and women, and finally it can damage DNA. A lethal dose is regarded as 100mg.<a href="http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/as.htm">Arsenic-As</a></p>
		<h3>Uses of arsenic</h3>
		<p>Arsenic has been used in the past as an insecticide as well as a wood preservative. Because of environmental issues it is no longer used as an insecticide and is being phased out as a wood preservative. As a wood preservative, the compound copper arsenate helped to stop wood from rotting and also kept termites and other insects from destroying the wood. Arsenic is combined with gallium to produce gallium arsenide for use in high speed electronics. Other applications for arsenic include metal alloys and glassmaking.<a href="http://www.chemicool.com/elements/arsenic.html">Arsenic Element Facts</a></p>
